/*
 * This project scrapes the website https://quackr.io/ for texts made to temporary phone numbers,
 * because these are often OTP codes - meaning we can use these as training data. We fetch all available
 * countries, then fetch all available phone numbers for each country, then fetch all available messages,
 * and persist them to a CSV file.
 *
 * At the time of writing this code, neither the T&Cs or Privacy Policy of Quakr.io forbid scraping their
 * site, nor do they claim any IP rights or copyright over the data on their site. They also claim
 * "no responsibility in the content of the messages", so I believe it's fair use to collect data from
 * Quakr.io in this manner. Before using this tool, please double check any T&Cs/Privacy Policy documents
 * on their site to make sure that you are not violating any of their terms by using this tool.
